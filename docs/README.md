# Hearth OS
Hearth OS isn't a normal operating system! Instead of data collection, required updates, strange UIs, or what you normally see. You see what you want to see! With the community at the heart we keep it how you want it to keep it!

## Rules!
It's for you under the [License](https://github.com/Hearth-OS/Hearth-OS/blob/main/LICENSE). Although we have to have rules, due to how community focused we are, we need to make everyone feel at home so we have a [Security Policy](https://github.com/Hearth-OS/Hearth-OS/blob/main/docs/SECURITY.md), to stay away from hackers and viruses!

## Changes
**Notice:** :construction: Hearth OS is not a finished product so please report bugs! :construction:
